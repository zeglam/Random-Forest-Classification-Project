# Random-Forest-Classification-Project

This project is a part of Python for data science and machine learning bootcamp. 

#### Data Scource
The data set is publicly available from LendingClub.com. 
Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). 
We will use lending data from 2007-2010.

#### Project Summary
We will create a model that will help predict people with a high probability of paying you back their loans.

The __goal__ is to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.

#### Conclusion 
Random forest performed better than a single decision tree when it comes to 'not.fully.paid = 0' class; on the other hand, it actually performed worst for the other class. 
These final results can be improved by using further data cleaning techniques to solve the huge imbalance in our dataset.

Final Accuracy: 0.83
